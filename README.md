The Odin Project 
Specifications are on the website, will probably make this project hidden as it's just practice for now.

Things I've learned during this project:

-How to space things using different units of measurements such as: vh and vw, percentages.
-More practice with flexbox
-Utilizing forms
-Colours and box shadows
-Font types
